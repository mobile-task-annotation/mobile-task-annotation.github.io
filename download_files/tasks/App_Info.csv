com.opengarden.firechat,FireChat,Social,Free messaging. No signal or mobile data needed.<br>INTERNET OF US (TM),"Free messaging. No signal or mobile data needed. It's the ""INTERNET OF US"" (TM)

FireChat works even without an Internet connection or cellular phone coverage. Use it anywhere: planes, public transportation, cruise ships, campuses, and crowded events. All you need is a few people around you using FireChat. 

Bluetooth and WiFi need to be ""on"" to send and receive messages when not connected to a network (yes please turn WiFi on, even if you don't have access to the Internet). And if you are connected to a cellular network or WiFi access point, then FireChat will work too. 

You will be automatically connected directly with one another, creating your own network for public and private communications. The more people use it, the bigger and faster your network becomes. 

And when you do have access to a reliable Internet connection or cellular network, FireChat helps you reach people worldwide and build your audience faster than on any social network, for free. 

Leaders, artists, communities and organizations (news, cultural, humanitarian, sports...) love how quickly FireChat scales. FireChat helps them communicate instantly with large groups of people to achieve their goals. 

Get FireChat now with a few friends and start something.

========= How does this work ? =========

FireChat creates a mesh network using Bluetooth and peer-to-peer WiFi. FireChat transmits messages and pictures offline between devices that are located within 200 feet of one another. 

Thanks to FireChat’s innovative multi-hop and store-and-forward capabilities, FireChat users form a network that increases in size with the number of devices. It allows messages to hop from one device to the next in order to reach the recipient(s). This is why the more people use FireChat, the better and the larger the network becomes (unlike with cellular networks). 

On the mesh network, messages are transmitted seamlessly from one device to the next in order to reach the recipient(s). When an Internet connection or cellular network is available, FireChat uses them to reach remote recipients. 

Public messages are visible by anyone. Private messages are encrypted and can only be seen and read by the sender and the recipient. 

========= Features =========
• Instantly send messages and photos to anyone around you
• Send private messages that only you and the recipient can read thanks to end-to-end encryption
 • Instantly create live chatrooms for discussions on any topic with a few people or as many as tens of thousands of simultaneous users 
• Type a hashtag in any message to automatically create a new chatroom
• View the most popular messages in the public conversations
• Public chatrooms and private messages work both offline and online
• Works even without any Internet connection, mobile phone coverage , or data plan
• Devices connect directly with one another within 200 feet of their location
• Multihop and store-and-forward technology create larger networks when several people use FireChat

FireChat has been featured by CNN, the BBC, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, USA Today, Time, and many more around the world. 

FireChat is often used at live events - such as the visit of Pope Francis in the Philippines in January 2015 - and large festivals including SXSW where it received an Innovation Award in March 2015.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RXBirGlhY5T_ST1Gvoa5UnButXwfouG26yZqaeL3f56Z2vfzgAc4csMljT6suCjh0tw,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BsOaZ8JhPhwCtyscXx1ML2WPc8cnTHH6uu2miza-GYKkhFbLWfGY4p39caEWA7MvqPVW,0.0,3.5762684,21M,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opengarden.firechat&hl=en&gl=us

com.google.android.apps.fitness,Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,Health & Fitness,Want to take charge of your health? Let Google Fit help you reach your goals.,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you two new activity goals that can help improve your health: Move Minutes and Heart Points

 • Move Minutes
When it comes to your health, it's important to move more and sit less. Earn Move Minutes for all of your activity and get motivated to make small, healthier changes throughout your day, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or catching up with a friend over a walk instead of a coffee.

 • Heart Points
Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity, like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental well-being.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH
Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS
See your daily progress for Heart Points and Move Minutes. Meeting your goals each day? Based on your activity and goal progress, Google Fit will help you adjust them so you can keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT
If you walk, run, or bike during the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points and Move Minutes you earn.

GET COACHING THAT FITS YOU
Get customized tips and actionable coaching, like help adjusting your goals based on your activity

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES
Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

com.appstar.callrecorder,Automatic Call Recorder,Tools,The best way to record your phone calls.,"Record any phone call you want and choose which calls you want to save. You can set which calls are recorded and which are ignored. Listen to the recording, add notes and share it. Integration with Google Drive™ and Dropbox allows calls to be saved and synchronized to the cloud as well. 
Google Drive integration works on Android versions 3.0 and above.
Please note that call recording does not work on certain handsets and can result in inferior quality recordings. We therefore suggest that you try the free version before purchasing the paid app.
If you encounter any recording issues or wish to improve voice quality, try recording from a different audio source, or use auto-on speaker mode.
Recorded calls are stored in the Inbox. You can set the size of the inbox. The number of saved calls is limited only by your device memory. If you decide that a conversation is important, save it and it will be stored in the Saved Calls folder. If not, old recordings will automatically be deleted when new calls fill up the inbox.
You can enable a Call Summary Menu with options to appear immediately after a call.
Search for recordings by contact, phone number, or note.

There are 3 default settings for automatic recording:
Record everything (default) – This setting records all calls except for contacts pre-selected to be ignored.
Ignore everything – This setting records no calls except for contacts pre-selected to be recorded.
Ignore contacts – This setting records all calls with people who are not contacts, except for contacts pre-selected to be recorded.
In the Pro version only: You can set calls from particular contacts to be automatically saved, and they will be saved in the cloud.

com.whatsapp,WhatsApp Messenger,Communication,Simple. Personal. Secure.,"WhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for Android and other smartphones.

• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes.

• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. 

• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.

com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher,Trigger - Task Launcher,Tools,"Automating the tasks you do daily. Launch applications, conserve battery &amp; more.","Bored of putting your phone on silent every time you get into the office? Tired of turning off Bluetooth to conserve battery every time juice gets low?

This app interacts with your surroundings to configure settings on your phone automatically. Combine triggers and actions to create tasks, then activate the tasks that you create with conditions that you set!

Here are examples of what you can do:

In your car: Use Bluetooth as a trigger to open GPS and launch your favorite music app

On your nightstand: Program an NFC tag to set your ringer to vibrate, dim your display and set an alarm

In your house: Use WiFi as a trigger to silence your phone, connect to bluetooth, and play your favorite songs.

The current free triggers are as follows:

-NFC
-Bluetooth
-Wifi

And as part of our Pro-Upgrade we also have these additional triggers: 

-Battery Level
-Location
-Time triggers
-Charging
-Calendar Events
-Agent
-Headset

And here are a few examples of the actions that you can perform with Trigger task launcher:

- Change WiFi, Bluetooth, mobile hotspot, airplane mode (root users in Jelly Bean and up), auto-sync, GPS and mobile data settings (root users).
- Change your volumes or notification tones.
- Change your display brightness, timeout, auto-rotation, or notification light settings
- Check in on social media like Foursquare or Google Places
- Send messages using Twitter, SMS, Email, or Glympse
- Start or stop Applications (root required for stopping most applications), dock modes, open URLs, speak text, or navigate to an address
- Set Alarms or create calendar events
- MORE!

Trigger is a task launcher that allows you to easily program your device to do the actions you do regularly.

So go ahead and create your own combinations to automate your life. The only limit is what you can come up with! 

The Wall Street Journal calls it ""living in the future.""

Additional actions can be found when experimental features are enabled in advanced settings. Auto lock screen and airplane mode are restricted by Android but we've created some work around solutions for these actions. (Note: They aren't 100% reliable which is why they're classed as ""experimental features"").

Some demos can be viewed on the application website

Note: When using NFC Tags you can create a Switch task that will toggle between two tasks with each tap.

We're always working on adding new actions to Tasks.  Please get in touch if there's something you'd like to do that's not currently offered.

This application supports NFC Forum Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 Tags as well as third party NFC Enabled tags like the MIFARE Classic, DESFire, Ultralight and Ultralight C. Now supporting read-only tags & allowing you to write any amount of data to any tag using Tagstand's cloud service.

net.ohanasiya.android.flickwallnet,automatic wallpaper changer 3,Tools,Personalize your device by turning your favorite photos into wallpaper!,"--- Turn your favorite photos into wallpaper! ---

Have fun personalizing your device with images of friends, family members, special memories—anything you choose! You can even use images stored on an SD card.

--- Schedule your wallpaper to change automatically! ---

With this application, you can select any saved image and have it automatically be displayed as your wallpaper for a set amount of time. You can even set the wallpaper to be changed when the screen is off, and this app won’t interfere with any other operations. You can choose to show images from newest to oldest, oldest to newest, or randomly. You can also set the app to start automatically when you turn the power on.

--- Automatic resizing! ---

Choose one of three settings for the display of your image: no adjustments, full display, or no gaps. The no gaps feature automatically adjusts your image to fit your screen perfectly.

--- Many intervals to choose from! ---

It’s possible to change your wallpaper image in intervals from every five minutes to once a day.

--- Unlimited wallpaper images! ---

There is no limit to the number of images you can register to AWC3. As long as you have space, you can register an image to AWC3.

--- Saves memory! ---

This app does not create unnecessary copies of your images to use as wallpaper. Instead, in order to save memory, it only registers the file information of images selected for use as wallpaper.

--- Saves energy! ---

When your screen is off, changes to your wallpaper are limited to once in order to save energy. Until you turn your screen on again, the wallpaper won’t be changed. (This feature went live with version 3.3. Not only is this feature intended to save battery life, but it also corrected a bug when trying to operate the device after the screen comes out of sleep mode.)

--- Improved response! ---

In order to avoid interfering with the normal operation of your device, special consideration was taken to separate the wallpaper changing program and the program that controls your device’s display. (If you notice a one-second delay in your device’s responsiveness, this is a problem with your device’s Android system or the device itself.)

--- Choose your notifications! ---

An icon can be set to display on your device’s status bar whenever the application is activated. Each time the wallpaper changes, the icon will animate. You can also have notifications displayed via toast window (short message). Both of these notifications can be turned off. The AWC3 widget on your home screen, which allows you to change the wallpaper at a tap without starting up the app, also animates whenever changes to the wallpaper are made, and the color changes when the on/off status of the app changes.

--- Notices ---

This application will connect to the internet to display advertisements.

TIPS:

* For Google Now Launcher users: The launcher displays the left part of the wallpaper.  In the preferences tab, please check ""change default page"" option on, and set the number of pages to 2 or more, the default page to 1.

* About the lock screen wallpaper: Because Android OS prior to 7.0 doesn't provide standard APIs for this operation, this app cannot do anything directly. However, if you save the resized image, you can set it to the lock screen from the gallery with your device's standard tools.

* Cropping uses a lot of memory. If you get an out of memory error, please crop the image with the gallery etc. before using it with this app.

• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes.

com.whatsapp,WhatsApp Messenger,Communication,Simple. Personal. Secure.,"WhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for Android and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. 

WHY USE WHATSAPP: 

• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.

• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp). 

• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.

• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.

• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* 

• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. 

• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. 

• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.

• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.

• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!

FAQ
What can I do with the “Folder listener” trigger?
If your device has built-in screenshot capability you can set the app to listen for changes to a folder. As soon as an image is created in that folder Screenshot Ultimate will trigger (for editing, saving, etc). You could also use another screenshot app, like Screenshot UX, Screenshot Free, Screenshot Easy, Screenshot and Draw, Screenshot ER, Screenshot HD or Screenshot It, and use Screenshot Ultimate to handle the editing / saving.

No “Capture Method” available for my device!
This is normal if your device isn't rooted. It's the way how the Android security model works; it just doesn't allow taking a screenshot on some devices. However, you can enable screenshot functionality on your device by enabling it through a computer. To see how you can do this go to “Screenshot Ultimate” > “Settings” > “Capture methods” > “No capture method help”. You can email the manual to yourself so you can complete it on your computer (Windows, Linux or Mac OSX).

اشعار حافظ را پیامک کنید

درباره‌ی دیوان حافظ
مشهور است که امروزه در خانه‌ی هر ایرانی، یک دیوان حافظ یافت می‌شود. ایرانیان طبق رسومِ قدیمی خود در روزهای عیدِ ملی یا مذهبی، نظیر نوروز بر سر سفره هفت سین، و یا شب یلدا، با کتاب حافظ فال می‌گیرند.

دیوان حافظ، مشتمل بر حدود ۵۰۰ غزل، چند قصیده، دو مثنوی، چندین قطعه و تعدادی رباعی است و در این برنامه فقط غزلهای این دیوان گنجانده شده‌اند. دیوان حافظ تاکنون بیش از چهارصد بار به اشکال و شیوه‌های گوناگون، به زبان فارسی و دیگر زبان‌های جهان به چاپ رسیده‌است. شاید تعداد نسخه‌های خطّی ساده یا تذهیب‌شده‌ی آن در کتابخانه‌های ایران، افغانستان، هند، پاکستان، ترکیه و حتی کشورهای غربی از هر دیوان فارسی دیگری بیشتر باشد. نکتهٔ خاصی که در دیوان حافظ وجود دارد، کثرت نسخه‌هایی با مفردات و واژه‌های گوناگون است که این خصیصه باعث بروز تصحیحات متعدد و گاه متناقض هم در بین مصححان می‌شود. یکی از صنایع شعری ایهام است بدین معنی که از یک کلمه معانی متفاوتی برداشت می‌شود. ایهام در اشعار حافظ به صورت گسترده مورد استفاده قرار گرفته. همچنین از مهم‌ترین خصوصیات شعر حافظ گستردگی مطالب ذکر شده در یک غزل اوست؛ به گونه‌ای که در یک غزل از موضوع‌های فراوانی حرف می‌زند. از طرفی هر بیت شعر حافظ نیز به طور مستقل قابل تفسیر است.

فال، با دیوان حافظ در بین ایرانیان یک رسم عمومی است. دیوان شعر خواجه شمس الدین حافظ شیرازی از پر طرفدارترین کتبی است که در خانه هر ایرانی وجود دارد. ایرانیان برای تفنن و شاید برای تصمیم گیری با زدن فال به این دیوان فرصتی برای خواندن شعر و تفسیر آن به خیر و صلاح یا به شر و ناصواب پیدا می‌کنند و برای گرفتن فال، آداب مختلف و شیوه‌های گوناگونی دارند که یکی از مرسوم‌ترین شیوه‌های فال گرفتن با دیوان حافظ به این صورت است که ابتدا فاتحه‌ای برای حضرت حافظ خوانده می‌شود و پس از ذکر صلوات، نیّت می‌کنند؛ منظور از نیّت کردن این است که موضوع فال را، در قالب یک سوال واضح در ذهن خود مجسم می‌کنند و سپس بصورت تصادفی صفحه‌ای از دیوان را می‌گشایند. شایان ذکر است که فال گرفتن بهتر است که در تنهایی انجام شود و گرفتن بیش از یک فال با یک نیّت و در یک زمان، بی‌احترامی به حضرت حافظ به شمار می‌رود.




به سبب علاقه و ارادتی که شخصاً به حضرت حافظ، شعر، ادبیات و فرهنگ کهن پارسی دارم تصمیم گرفتم که سهم کوچکی در راه اشاعه‌ی این مهم‌ها داشته باشم و اپلیکیشن دیوان حافظ نیز حاصل این علاقه و ارادت است و امیدوارم که استفاده از این اپلیکیشن موجبات خشنودی و رضایت شما را فراهم آورد.

""Sorry for the quality, mobile."" Almost everyone makes excuses when publishing a photo taken with a camera phone. What are the problems taking good quality pictures with camera phones and is there a way to solve them and bridge the gap between camera phones and compact cameras?
You may think there is very little difference between a cell phone camera and a point-and-shoot camera. Nowadays, mobile phone cameras have enough megapixels. The phones have enough storage capacity. Even the lens quality is not as bad as before and can compete with low-end compact cameras.
At the same time, a big gap still exists when it comes to the basis of photography – the light source. If you take pictures in daylight, you may be satisfied with the quality of mobile images. However, when you move to a less bright indoor environment, you start to notice the difference. Mobile images appear to have more noise, they are usually blurry and lack detail in shadows. Bright areas turn into pure-white spots. Faces seem unnaturally flat, especially when using a flash. Getting into a darker environment extends the gap. While images taken with a regular camera are not very good but still do show a scene, mobile images become unacceptably blurry and show almost nothing but smeared lights and the camera’s own noise.

Almalence, Inc. has developed a technology that combines a special exposure mode and software post-processing to greatly reduce the blur effects and improve dynamic range.

FAQ

Q: Isn't it better to use the standard camera and then improve the photos in Photoshop?

A: It is always better to take a quality image than to improve a bad one. It is usually impossible to remove heavy blur or reduce high noise without losing image details.
Night Camera does not apply deblurring or noise reduction filters to a standard image, it gets a better image from the sensor.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7fUn0cWxQ8Ml2-BOvC5Qk9PQagp5A-q002x-CUt-cUI5yqBzfxITSRwrgk85-_uakzM,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xIXf-teisjsvEbTcLE9Dv-wuZl_71yGL3A-2dEWnVnCHP6fTrxD1ey2aaeluIbTgUW-L,0.99,3.8927577,2.8M,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almalence.night_plus&hl=en&gl=us

com.whatsapp,WhatsApp Messenger,Communication,Simple. Personal. Secure.,"WhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for Android and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages. 

WHY USE WHATSAPP: 

• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.

• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes.

• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.

• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.* 

• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book. 

• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. 

• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.

• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.

• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!

com.midasensemble.hiddeneye,Hidden Eye: Catch your friends,Tools,Try this amazing app to catch your friends snooping ur phone while you&#39;re away.,"Ever wanted to know who tried snooping into your phone while you were away. Your friends or family member might have tried to unlock your phone. Hidden Eye is a simple app with no frills that will photograph the person when they try to unlock your phone. You can set it to play your ringtone when a user tries to unlock your phone without your knowledge.

I am first writing how to uninstall, as there are several users who are unable to install it as they miss reading the instructions. This is for such users

HOW TO UNINSTALL ?
You need to first deactivate HiddenEye from the Device Administrator. The settings for device administrators can be found in Location and Security > Device administrators in the android system setting

This app uses the Device Administrator permission.

Go to SETTINGS->Location and Security-> Device Administrator and deselect the ""HiddenEye"" which you want to uninstall.

Now, you  should be able to uninstall the app. If you launch Google Play and open up HiddenEye, you should see the Open & Uninstall buttons. If the admin access is active, you will see a ""Deactivate"" button

TO USE?
* Enable screen security lock on your phone.
* Install and launch the app ""HiddenEye""
* Set the Security Status to ON.
* Activate the device admin for Hidden Eye and that's it. You are now ready for the action.



Sync with Dropbox
All the images that are captured is stored in ""HiddenEye"" folder within the DCIM folder on your phone. If you have configured Dropbox to sync your Photos folder, then Hiddeneye pictures will also be synced with your dropbox account.

Android detects failed attempts ONLY if passcode has atleast 4 letters or points, so as HiddenEye

This app may not work on all devices, you will need to just try it out and see if it works for your device. Email me if it doesn't work on your device. Does not take pictures on Nexus devices


PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE YOUR ISSUES ON THE COMMENT SECTION AS I CANNOT REACH YOU FOR ANY CLARIFICATIONS. EMAIL YOUR ISSUES TO ""support@midasensemble.com"" BEFORE LEAVING IT ON THE COMMENT SECTION. 

Like our Facebook page to stay connected to updates on HiddenEye and other exciting products that we are working on.
http://www.facebook.com/midasensemble

Worried that your phone does not have front camera. With HiddenEye, now you can know the someone has tried to snoop into your phone. You can also trigger sound if someone is trying to unlock your phone with wrong password thrice.  You will see a place holder image instead of a real picture. If you have a front camera, then you will see the real picture of the intruder.

Once you unlock your phone, you will be shown the photographs of the people who tried unlocking your phone in your absence. Sounds interesting ! Try it and let us know if you have any suggestion to improve it further. 

About Permissions
CAMERA = Uses the front camera to picture the intruder.
VIBRATE = Notification Alert generated when wrong password is entered.
INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE = Needs to display Ads on the app.

• Quick or full file system scans, as well as custom scans, of user-specified files and folders.
The SpIDer Guard monitor scans file systems in real-time whenever an attempt is made to store files and applications in the device’s memory.

•  Neutralisation of ransomware lockers: malicious processes are terminated even if a device is locked; lockers not yet present in the Dr.Web virus database are blocked; data remains intact, eliminating the need to pay criminals a ransom.

•  The unique Origins Tracing™ technology is used to detect new, unknown malware. 

•  Detected threats are moved to the quarantine from which isolated files and applications can be restored, if needed.

•  Minimal impact on system performance. 

•  Restrained use of battery resources. 

•  Frugal data usage due to the small size of the virus database updates—a big plus for users whose mobile device plans have usage limits.

•  Detailed statistics reveal what threats have been detected and what actions have been taken with them.

•  A convenient and informative widget for working with the SpIDer Guard file monitor.

+++ Remove free app first +++

+++IMPORTANT+++
Be aware that after using FakeGPS you may find your location LOCKED TO THE LAST MOCKED LOCATION EVENT AFTER UNINSTALL FakeGPS! It's not a bug and your GPS sensor isn't broken. There are two ways to fix this issue:
  1. Install ""GPS Status"" from the Play, launch and get a fresh GPS fix. You may need to repeat it several times with 30 min interval.
  2. Start FakeGPS, set your real location and leave it so for several hours.
You may combine these steps. The issue will disappear in one or two days - be patient.

For ROOTED devices you can mock locations without enabling ""Allow mock locations"" option. To do so please use Root Explorer or other similar app and move /data/app/ru.lexa.fakegps~1.apk to /system/priv-app or to /system/app (for Android 4.3 and older). Then change apk permissions to rw-r-r and reboot your device. If you find apk in /syste/priv-app disappears after reboot it means that your devices has S-ON mode enabled and so restores /system folder aftear each reboot. Please google how to switch your device to S-OFF mode. 

If you can't find ru.lexa.fakegps.apk in /data/app you may find it at /mnt/asec/ru.lexa.fakegps/1.apk. In this case you should copy and rename it to /system/priv-app/ru.lexa.fakegps.apk.",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0RfjbIp1EioNCRL-J9vWx8Xntxu039JX3Ot_rMBfP3JuGv0g3i1q6xgfaJ1B30VduEU,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vf7oSHivndQbCPMHfSya2bmHdT5yQ0klvhwMSqTpMVvZHkp6jeBqw07l_0S4XeHyKg,2.99,4.34276,Varies with device,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegpsdonate&hl=en&gl=us

com.lima.doodlejump,Doodle Jump,Arcade,One of the best mobile games of all time. As INSANELY addictive as ever!,"Named Best of 2015 by Google Play editors! Thank you for all of your support.

One of the hottest mobile games of all time! Easy to pick up and play. Wildly addictive.
 
See for yourself why Touch Arcade called Doodle Jump “possibly the best [mobile] game ever created” and Macworld called it “a perfect micro-game, insanely addictive, and deliciously replayable.”
 
How high can you get?
Journey up a sheet of graph paper, perpetually jumping from one platform to the next, picking up jet packs, avoiding black holes, and blasting baddies with nose balls along the way. Laugh with delight as you blow past other players' actual score markers scribbled in the margins. And be warned: this game is insanely addictive!
 
Features:
-	Many fantastical worlds to play in - Ninja, Space, Jungle, Soccer, Underwater, Snow, Halloween, Frozen Ice, Easter and Pirates!
-	Awesome power-ups to pick-up (JET PACKs, PROPELLER HATS, ROCKETS, trampolines...)
-	Trippy obstacles to avoid (UFOs, black holes, and many, many monstrous monsters)
-	Mad platforms to jump on (Broken, moving, disappearing, shifting, EXPLODING…)
-	NEW! - More than 100 missions to complete for rewards
-	Global leaderboards, fun achievements! Beat your friends’ scores!

How to play: 
Tilt to move left or right, tap the screen to shoot. 


As seen on TV, movies, late-night and on tour with the most famous pop star in the world, find out why Doodle Jump is a true cultural phenomenon.

* BE WARNED: This game is INSANELY addictive! 
* Don't doodle jump and drive!


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you bought Doodle Jump in the past, make sure you have it installed on your device* when you install this new version! That will remove the ads. If you have already uninstalled/deleted the old paid Doodle Jump version, you can re-download it from ""My Android Apps"" -> ""Other apps in my library"" or by going directly to: http://bit.ly/oldpaid  

* This will work for most devices, but unfortunately not the ones that the old paid version is not compatible with. We are trying to come up with a solution for those.

§ Privacy:
We respect your privacy!
Unlike many other horoscope apps we DO NOT require ridiculous permissions like location, phone state, address book etc... We recommend avoiding apps that require these without proper justification. There are horoscope apps claiming they need your location to deliver you the horoscope. Just check from any other location (ask a friend in another country/state/city) - it will not make the slightest difference and then ask yourself if they lie about that, can you trust anything else they say? We urge you to review permissions carefully and uninstall apps that violate your privacy right away.


§ Permissions Explanation:
• INTERNET - required to download the horoscope
• BOOT - required to be able to re-schedule reminders (if any were set) after phone restart
***Note - this does not have any impact on the battery since the app does not run in the background

• Play for absolutely free and access all features
• Form tribes, chat and play with your friends
• Tons of achievements

• Fruitcraft is designed to work with a very weak internet connection, so will literally work ANYWHERE!
